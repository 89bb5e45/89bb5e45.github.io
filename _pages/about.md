I am a classicist, social scientist, and software engineer with interests in crisis, caste, and institutions. I've taught a variety of classes in political science and legal studiea, and have an additional, narrow-ish academic focus on the historiography and political culture of the Roman late-republic, especially as these topics relate to discourses, narratives, and intellectual traditions on the core ideas of that period. I am a RedHat Certified System Administrator with about fifteen years experience managing Unix systems, developing software, and analyzing data. All views are my own.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
