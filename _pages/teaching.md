#### LS 450: Introduction to Law and the Humanities (Planned)

**Department**: Legal Studies, University of Wisconsin-Madison  
**Terms**: Fall 2025, Spring 2026  
**Approx. Number of Students**: 70/Semester
**Role**: Lecturer
**Description**: I've developed a course curriculum introducing students to the intersection of law and humanities. This course is meant to help students who are considering law school understand how humanist interpretive approaches inform the practice and theory of law. In this role, I will also supervise a university-appointed grader. This is part of a broader project I've been involved in to develop an interdisciplinary certificate program on law and humanities at the University of Wisconsin, which you can read about at the following link: [Law and Humanities](/projects/law_and_humanities/).

#### LS 444: Law in Action

**Department**: Legal Studies, University of Wisconsin-Madison  
**Terms**: Fall 2024, Spring 2025  
**Approx. Number of Students**: 70/semester
**Role**: Lecturer  
**Description**: As sole instructor for this course, I introduced students to the theory and practice of the American legal system through the University of Wisconsin’s "Law in Action" approach. The course examined how social goals shape legal rules, the interaction between practitioners and scholars, and the range of legal practice areas available to students considering law school. I significantly refined the curriculum between semesters, prioritizing participation and writing assignments to enhance students’ analytical and communication skills. I supervised multiple university-appointed graders. Additionally, I supervised two student research projects related to the course. I published one of my lesson plans for this course at the following link: [How I Take Notes](/blog/2025/how-i-take-notes/).
