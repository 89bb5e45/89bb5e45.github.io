Part of the difficulty of teaching this subject is in helping students understand how and why the underlying concepts change over time. This presents an interesting ‚Äúteaching methods‚Äù challenge that I‚Äôve contemplated throughout the semester and struggled to find a good solution for.</p> <p>I view this fundamentally as a definitional problem: it‚Äôs hard to pin down a comprehensive meaning for liberalism or conservatism, partly because of the long, complex history of the two intellectual traditions, and partly because of the mixing of theories that practical politics tends to effectuate. These are ideas in motion. Neither set of ideas fits neatly into categories - each constitutes a theory of government, to be sure, but also a framework for applied policymaking, a literary and epistemic tradition, and an ideology for democratic politics. In short, I think we can conceptualize liberalism and conservatism as traditions sitting at the interface between epistemic communities and political culture.<d-footnote>Amanda Hollis-Brusky (2015) and Steven Teles (2010) have both written about this phenomenon as it relates to the modern conservative legal movement, which may be useful context to the claims I'm making here.</d-footnote> They are shaped both by how they are practiced and by how they are theorized. They do not simply emerge out of political necessity alone; they are long-running ideas that are challenged and sustained by scholarly communities. This makes them uniquely difficult to teach, because they are not static doctrines, nor purely academic constructs, but also not totally without structure and internal cohesion.</p> <p>Early in the class, we tackled this complexity by building mind maps of both concepts, establishing links and anti-links to gain a better understanding of each theory‚Äôs tenets and how they related to each other. Recurring themes for liberalism tended to include concepts like change, progress, economic freedom, liberty, and equality, while conservatism usually included tradition, religion, hierarchy, and stability. But this still didn‚Äôt account for changes to the ideas over time - that is, why a tenet like ‚Äútradition‚Äù might look different if you examine how the principle is carried out in the 18th Century as opposed to the 21st Century.</p> <p>One possible approach I considered was a participatory model where we created actual hats labeled ‚Äúconservative‚Äù and ‚Äúliberal‚Äù that students could wear as part of the classroom activities to think through historical problems from different perspectives. This would, at least in theory, free them from needing to take personal responsibility for challenging world views while still allowing us to derive learning value from the exercise. We could then introduce more complex sub-variants as the course progressed (an ‚Äúeconomic liberal‚Äù hat, for example). I decided against using this as my initial approach, however, because I felt it put too much pressure on students early in the semester - though it may prove a useful activity later on when students are more comfortable with the subject matter.</p> <p>Another approach involves using heuristics to simplify complex ideas. In law school, I took Trusts and Estates with a remarkable and engaging professor named Howard Erlanger, and part of his teaching method involved approaching complex ideas through a set of ‚ÄúErlanger‚Äôs Paradoxes‚Äù - a sort of theoretical shorthand to help students reach analytical conclusions faster given a limited set of facts. These were especially useful when the law neither said what it meant nor meant what it said. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt know if you have marital property in Wisconsin,‚Äù his first principle stated, ‚Äúthen you do.‚Äù I had a chance to sit down with him and pick his brain about my somewhat comparable pedagogical predicament, leading to what I‚Äôve taken to calling, in conscious emulation of my intellectual upstream, ‚ÄúSig‚Äôs Abstractions.‚Äù</p> <p>I‚Äôm writing this post <em>in media res</em> (with mixed feelings about my students reading it) because doing so has been helpful in developing these abstractions further, as well as a language to discuss them with my students. It‚Äôs important to note, however - and I hope my students understand this - that these are only a shorthand primarily rooted in the American context, and the interpretations of liberalism and conservatism presented here may grate with other academic, especially non-American, perspectives on the same.</p> <h4 id="i-the-horse-race">I. The Horse Race</h4> <p>The first problem I‚Äôve experienced in teaching liberalism and conservatism is, put simply, why neither of these ideas looks exactly the same as it did in the past. As an example: Adam Smith‚Äôs liberalism placed, I think, a far greater emphasis on free markets than today‚Äôs liberalism, which has adopted intervention as a core tenet. To square this circle, we would probably need to reach two conclusions: first, that liberalism outpaces conservatism; second, that conservatism is nonetheless also a ‚Äúmoving‚Äù idea that changes over time, though probably not at the same pace as liberalism.</p> <p>I find that this is best illustrated by the analogy of a horse race: if liberalism and conservatism were two horses that, for the purpose of the discussion, are situated at the same starting gate, then which horse will outpace the other at any arbitrary time?</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2023-10-22-horse_race-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2023-10-22-horse_race-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2023-10-22-horse_race-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/2023-10-22-horse_race.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Illustration of the horse race (source: author) </div> <p>If you put your money on liberalism, then you‚Äôve correctly made sense of the analogy. But, a more challenging question: does the fact that liberalism outpaces conservatism mean that the conservatism horse never left the starting post? Of course not. Conservatism generally tries to keep pace with the faster horse, but never passes it because this system of belief does not necessarily hold that ‚Äòthe race is to to the fastest alone.‚Äô Perhaps, to take this analogy a bit further, conservatism wishes that the race were oriented in the opposite direction, but at the same time doesn‚Äôt want to be left too far behind by the faster horse running the other way. Thus, we might see conservative thinkers and practitioners today adopt all manner of ideas that, in the 19th Century, might have seemed alien to those who identified with that label.</p> <h4 id="ii-the-caduceus">II. The Caduceus</h4> <p>The second teaching problem I‚Äôve experienced is why the two ideas seem sometimes to leverage similar language and ideas, or might be used to justify the same policies, despite differing significantly in their worldview. A good way to think about this might be that liberalism and conservatism are not ideas that exist in a vacuum - their scholars read each other‚Äôs work and respond to the same events, and intertexts are inevitable when given enough time. A useful way to visualize how concepts might converge is the image of the caduceus, a symbol that depicts two snakes wrapped around a staff and conveys a sense of mediation and diplomacy.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" style="height: 50%;"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2023-10-22-caduceus-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2023-10-22-caduceus-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2023-10-22-caduceus-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/2023-10-22-caduceus.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Two serpents wrapped around a staff (source: Ernest de Sarzec - Choquin de Sarzec, Ernest (1832-1901), Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons) </div> <p>So, in visualizing this idea, we might plot liberalism and conservatism as a wave function and its inverse, with the two waves periodically intersecting with one another.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2023-10-22-intertwined_lines-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2023-10-22-intertwined_lines-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2023-10-22-intertwined_lines-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/2023-10-22-intertwined_lines.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Illustration of two intersecting waves (source: author) </div> <p>This captures the responsiveness that each set of ideas has toward the the other. I suppose an underlying claim here, which I believe is a descriptive one, is that we can understand the development of these ideas as a dialogue across time and across communities, facilitated perhaps by the fact that these ideas are deeply entangled with an historiographic and scholarly tradition, as well as with political practice.</p> <h4 id="iii-wedges">III. Wedges</h4> <p>That liberalism and conservatism often diverge from one another is obvious, but the entanglements and the varied convictions of those who adhere to each set of ideas also result in divergences within a single intellectual tradition. This concept stands in contrast to the ‚Äúcaduceus‚Äù model described above, where similar language and outcomes emerge from different frameworks. Here, we observe how approaches to a given intellectual tradition may vary in ways that seem to break down that tradition‚Äôs conceptual cohesion.</p> <p>We could give this phenomenon a few different names. If we want to emphasize its result, we might refer to it as something like ‚Äòissue-based dichotomization.‚Äô If instead we are more interested in <em>how</em> the differences start to emerge, then (and I will substantiate this name shortly) something like ‚Äòliminal divergence‚Äô might make more sense. I‚Äôve taken to using the terminology of ‚Äòwedges‚Äô, a more accessible terminology that, I think, captures both the force that splits a community and the shape of the divide.</p> <p>A wedge is observed when individuals or groups that adhere to conservative or liberal principles hold different, often-contradictory positions on substantive policy issues when compared to others that adhere to the same principles. Can a liberal thinker authentically justify (as opposed to cynically, or for political purposes) qualified immunity based on a liberal worldview? Can a conservative thinker justify affirmative action based on a conservative worldview?</p> <p>It would be easy to dispense with this phenomenon by asserting that it is the natural product of everyday differences in opinion between people, or maybe a result of an academic process that encourages scholars to critique each other and distinguish their own thinking in order to carve out a place for themselves. I think, however, that the entangelements of liberalism and conservatism as ‚Äòliving‚Äô traditions indicates something deeper is happening here. Specifically, I would argue that these dichotomies emerge from the varying emphases on and interpretations of ‚Äòliminal‚Äô concepts and controversies by individuals who subscribe to the same general political philosophy when they confront real events and issues relevant to their own lives. Here, I use the term ‚Äòliminal‚Äô concept or controversy to describe contentious, abstract ideas that exist at the boundaries or thresholds of a single intellectual tradition at any given time. They might be matters of interpretation, where different scholars approach, accept, or reject them in different ways. They seldom make up the core tenets of that tradition and, as a result, are left sometimes without solid treatment by the scholarly community and perhaps willfully ignored by political practitioners until events cause them to become matters of ideological significance that may result in their deeper incorporation into a tradition‚Äôs core tenets. They may not be either fully embraced or entirely rejected by any single ideological group, but instead exist in a state of ambiguity or ambivalence. Another way to think of liminal concepts - and indeed I think that we are best served by treating this category of issues in a somewhat porous and inclusive manner - is as interacting obliquely with the intellectual tradition in question, rather than following squarely within the scope of the answers it proposes to offer about the world.</p> <p>It‚Äôs not clear that humans are principled creatures <em>per se</em>, even if we often try to appear so. More often, we tend to ‚Äúwindow shop‚Äù for the principles that get us what we want.<d-footnote>There is a lot of interesting literature on this. Something I've read for class recently is Briffault (2018) 2025-27, who discusses unprincipled behavior as it relates to federalism.</d-footnote> One of the problem with principles is that they seldom provide an answer to <em>every</em> question we need to answer, all the more so when we are compelled to confront and incorporate new information off the cuff. We are also flawed creatures: a system of belief may provide a perfectly good answer to a question, but our understanding of how it does so may be incomplete or mistaken, resulting in apparently unprincipled behavior. But beyond this, I also think that there is room within a system of belief like liberalism and conservativism for variation, so long as this variation occurs about the mean, and that the source for this variation often comes down to how people think about somewhat unrelated ideas. This variation ought not be considered unprincipled. In fact, there may be great utility to these intellectual traditions remaining elastic and capable to evolution - indeed, this may very well be why they have stood the test of time.</p> <p>So, I‚Äôd argue that analyzing wedges is not about unmasking hypocrisy, but understanding the pluralistic (and often improvisational) nature of how intellectual traditions and practical ideologies develop. There are, assuredly, many liminal controversies on which to internally dichotomize liberalism and conservatism. A good way to approach the matter is to ask whether there are thing that some liberals agree with some conservatives on, but which large numbers of liberals (or conservatives) will disagree with themselves upon. Off the top of my head, there are a few such concerns that are obvious: whether the interests of the individual or the community should take precedence; whether to adopt a position that supports or critiques the existing political status quo; whether justice or stability ought to triumph in the public policy; whether to place greater emphasis on material concerns or broader symbolic and ideological ones; whether to approach reform incrementally or ambitiously. If you‚Äôve sensed a strong normative tone in the concerns listed above, then you‚Äôve caught an important aspect of the wedge: that it refers to normative splits within communities regarding matters not clearly resolved by the intellectual traditions to which they subscribe.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2023-10-22-diverging_lines-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2023-10-22-diverging_lines-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2023-10-22-diverging_lines-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/2023-10-22-diverging_lines.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Illustration of issue-based divergence (source: author) </div> <h4 id="iv-the-ouroboros">IV. The Ouroboros</h4> <p>The previous conceptualizations presume that ideas and institutions always move forward. However, this linear progression doesn‚Äôt always hold true in the real world. They don‚Äôt just move forward; they also circle back, revisiting and reinterpreting past concepts. This leads us to a third teaching problem: why the ideas often seem to hearken back or revert to past approaches. Admittedly, this phenomenon is something that will become more apparent in discussions of more recent events as we are able to observe how history sometimes ‚Äúrepeats itself.‚Äù For example, debates around the First National Bank were largely focused on constitutional interpretation, but later debates were able to leverage experience and history as evidence for or against the bank‚Äôs rechartering.</p> <p>This may seem to suggest that ‚Äòhearkening back‚Äô could be an aspect of the political practice and culture surrounding these traditions. The notion of ‚Äúhearkening back‚Äù might be a particularly unsurprising phenomenon for conservatism, which places a far greater an emphasis on history and tradition - but even liberalism has a tendency toward archaics. Take, for instance, the resurgence of classical liberal ideas among libertarians. While classical liberalism emphasizes individual liberty and limited government, it‚Äôs been reinterpreted and adapted by modern libertarians to address contemporary issues. Whether or not libertarians constitute a ‚Äòliberal‚Äô or ‚Äòconservative‚Äô group will necessarily invite debate, but what‚Äôs clear is that their core tenets draw heavily from early liberal thought.</p> <p>But this analogy goes further than the platitude that ‚Äòhistory often repeats itself.‚Äô Rather, the idea of cyclicality in these intellectual traditions may be closely tied to the behavior of academics, and the fact that liberalism and conservatism have a long history. Scholary communities have grown, especially over the last century, to have their own canons of thinking that engage closely with the history of their particular place and discipline, and so ‚Äòlooking back‚Äô at how we thought about issues in the past is relevant both in solving the problems that liberalism and conservatism seek to solve, but also in an academic environment where your credibility relies on your ability to engage with the history of the area of study wherein you find yourselve. This is exercerbated, perhaps, by the fact that academia writ large is an increasingly crowded field.</p> <p>I think this idea is nicely modeled by the tail eater (Attic: ·ΩÅ Œø·ΩêœÅŒøŒ≤œåœÅŒøœÇ), another ancient symbol of life, death, and rebirth - or, in a more abstract sense, the cyclicality that permeates all areas of life, to help illustrate how liberalism and conservatism don‚Äôt just move forward, but can sometimes hearken to old arrangements.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2023-10-22-ouroboros-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2023-10-22-ouroboros-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2023-10-22-ouroboros-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/2023-10-22-ouroboros.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> The serpent devours its own tail (source: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Serpiente_alquimica.jpg" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">anonymous medieval illuminator; uploader Carlos adanero</a>, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons) </div> <p>Represented in the same manner as the earlier concepts, it might look like two circles converging back upon themselves.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2023-10-22-circular_lines-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2023-10-22-circular_lines-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2023-10-22-circular_lines-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/2023-10-22-circular_lines.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Illustration of two curves converging back on themselves (source: author) </div> <h4 id="v-the-retracting-slinky">V. The Retracting Slinky</h4> <p>One final idea that has recently shaped my thinking is how technology like social media compresses the space between theory and practice, scholarship and politics. In an earlier time, the development of intellectual traditions were often constrained by geography, institutional access, disciplinary boundaries, and the slow pace of publication. But today, scholarly and ideological dialogues can happen instantaneously across space and asynchronously across time. Additionally, scholarly communities have reached far greater levels of maturity in ways that further facilitate this dialogue.</p> <p>I think of this like a retracting slinky: a metaphor for how ideas that were once stretched across vast temporal or disciplinary distances are now compressed together in a much closer space. The result is a kind of intensification: ideas move, grow, and mutate faster than ever before. The effect is not only on the spread of political rhetoric, but also on the role of the scholarly community itself, which can no longer claim to sit fully above the fray. It is instead deeply implicated in it. I think that this is evidenced by the fact that many professors are very active on social media platforms.</p> <p>The university, representative of the classic epistemic community - itself comprised of many, smaller such communities, is increasingly one node among many in a sprawling network. Its internal structures must increasingly engage dynamically with faster, less formal, and sometimes more ideologically driven modes of discourse. This accelerates the pace at which ideas move - but it also blurs the distinction between knowledge production and ideological practice.</p> <p>While this paper is not intended to be a review of Eric Hobsbawm, a brief appreciation of his ideas may be warranted. Hobsbawm argued that the phenomenon of inventing traditions became increasingly prevalent in the late 19th Century, coinciding with the rise of modern nation-states, industrialization, and mass society. These large-scale transformations created new demands for social cohesion, a shared identity, and institutional legitimacy - needs that traditions, whether ancient or newly constructed, could help fulfill. He defines invented tradition as a set of practices governed by rules that seek to instill certain values or norms through repetition, while implying continuity with a suitable historic past, even if that past is largely fictionalized. Distinct from customs, which organicly adapt over time, invented traditions tend to be fixed, ritualized, and often arise during moments of rupture or discontinuity. In this sense, the ‚Äòretracting slinky‚Äô seems to reflect such a rupture.</p> <h4 id="vi-closing-remarks">VI. Closing Remarks</h4> <p>These musings constitute a slightly cleaned up set of working notes that have evolved over the first few weeks of the academic term. Their purpose is to document how I have approached teaching students about intellectual traditions that are ‚Äòin motion‚Äô and, as a result, pose particular challenges to students who are themselves active consumers of and participants in the ideas as a matter of political practice. The goal of the abstractions that I‚Äôve developed above is to make the ideas accessible to students where they are at, and to find a way to illustrate how the ideas are implicate in an entangled set of concerns. Thank you for reading, and hopefully the effort has been rewarding and enjoyable.</p> <h4 id="-listen-to-this-page">üéß Listen to This Page</h4> <figure> <audio src="/assets/audio/2023-10-22-liberalism-conservatism.mp3" controls=""></audio> </figure> <p>To make this content more accessible and easier to engage with, I‚Äôve included an audio version generated using AI voice technology from <a href="https://www.elevenlabs.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ElevenLabs</a>.
